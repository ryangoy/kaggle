# NCFM fish recognition #

### To do: ###

* use [this guy's labels] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring/forums/t/25565/annotated-mouth-and-tail) to train a CNN to detect points on a fish
* apply affine transformation to the image and crop
* gamma balance and color balance (anything to do with image standardization i.e. linearlization and normalization)
* train a vgg16 network on labeled, processed training data
